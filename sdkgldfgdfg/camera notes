geometry point of plane in world space
box p 4
p of box -2
world p 0

4 + 0 = 4
-2 mul + 4 = 2

w p 2
4 + 2 = 6
-2 + 6 = 4

mousescreenUV x 10
w p 2
looking for mouse px 12? no on screen, since the camera does not yet move
its point is more to the left now, so 10 - 2 = 8
x 10 + wp Invert -2 = 8

cool, so now y
y is from bottom as is gl
but 3d is both, bottom up and in the center of screen at start
the app treats positive x y at bottom left same as UV coords
the mouse x y is also not transformed

so
w y = 2 which is up
mouse y 2 visually should be 0
invert also works here
w y 2 invert -2
y 2 + -2 = 0

NOW grid
this seeeeems to not matter, it handles coords the same for UV and thus 
should be transformable the same as above

MousePicking
Right now we are doing 2d point in box picking. Could upgrade or just swap to 
Raycasting, but FOR NOW well stick to the simpler technique

Need above transformed world space mouse
and that point tests if its in an objects bounding box

bounding box : bb
bb min = points[1] bottom left
bb max = points[3] top right
SHOUDLd be the first example
if not, whats the issue???????多多多多
