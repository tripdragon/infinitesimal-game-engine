## dev derps
so the idea is everything has a lv:n attribute, and the whole box is System1
if something gets a significant upgrade lv:2+ versioning is changed. Nothing complex just a stupid way to track the complexity of the file as it progresses at the start of reading

IF a System2 comes, we freeze everything into the folder and start on a new copy.
This way games have compatibility with previous
